    <b>Important Concepts</b><br><b><br></b>How the Web Works</b><br><br>
    The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web like www.google.com, their computer
    sends a <em>HTTP Requestto a server.</em> The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
    it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and dispalys
    it on the user's screen. <a href="www.thisvideo.com">This video</a> does a good job of explaining.
    
    <br><br>
    <b>HTML</b><br><br>
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents  form the majority of the content on the web. 
    HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em>
    which describes "how it looks". <a href="www.thisvideo.com">This video</a>gives a good overview.
    
    <p><b>Tags and Elements</b></p>
    HTML documents are made up of HTML <b>elements.</b>When writing HTML, we tell browsers the 
    type of each elememt by using HTML tags. <a href="www.thisvideo.com">This video</a> expalins the distinction well.
    
    <p><b>Why Computers are stupid</b></p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. 
    This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
    
    <p><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b></p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or<b> block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
